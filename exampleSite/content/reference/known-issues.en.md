# Known Issues

These issues will not be fixed for the time being. For details, see [Why Not Deca](blog/create-deca/#why-not-deca). However, they are documented here for reference.

1. The mobile navigation should be more streamlined.
2. A JS automatic sidebar collapsing feature is needed so that when `sidebarCachedRender` is enabled, the sidebar doesn’t fully expand. See [performance bottleneck](blog/create-deca/#performance-bottle-neck) for details.
3. The front matter should include options to mark new and deprecated content in the sidebar, similar to how MkDocs handles it.
