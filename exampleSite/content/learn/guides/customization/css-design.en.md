# CSS Design System

Deca adopts an intuitive and approachable CSS design system based on an Infima-style variable architecture. Users can easily customize the theme’s appearance without needing to understand complex CSS structures.

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by the Docusaurus styling system, it follows the same variable naming conventions and architecture, enabling users to create color themes that meet WCAG-AA accessibility standards.

## Customization Method

Create a file at `assets/css/custom.css` and paste in the color system generated by the [Docusaurus Theme Generator](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout#styling-your-site-with-infima).
Your configuration should look like this:

```css
:root {
    --ifm-color-primary: #2e8555;
    --ifm-color-primary-dark: #29784c;
    --ifm-color-primary-darker: #277148;
    /* ... */
}

html.dark {
    --ifm-color-primary: #25c2a0;
    --ifm-color-primary-dark: #21af90;
    --ifm-color-primary-darker: #1fa588;
    /* ... */
}
```
