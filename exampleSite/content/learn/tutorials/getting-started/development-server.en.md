# Start Development Server

Now let's start the Hugo development server to preview your Deca website locally.

## Start Server

Run in your website root directory:

```bash
hugo server
```

Or use draft mode:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

## Preview Website

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to preview your website.

## Live Reload

Hugo development server supports live reload. When you modify files, the browser will automatically refresh to show the latest content.

## Stop Server

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the development server.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully installed and started the Deca theme! Now you can begin creating your documentation content.
