# Hugo Theme Deca

[中文](https://github.com/zhenshuo2021/hugo-theme-deca/blob/main/README.zh-TW.md)

Deca is a modern documentation theme built for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), supporting multiple sidebars and Single-Page Application (SPA) functionality to deliver a smoother and more scalable documentation browsing experience.

## Core Features

* Supports multiple sidebars, suitable for large or multi-module documentation structures
* Built-in SPA navigation with seamless, flicker-free page transitions
* Three-column layout providing clear navigation and contextual positioning
* Powered by Hugo's efficient static generation mechanism, optimized for medium to large documentation systems

## Why Choose Deca

Existing Hugo documentation themes lack SPA navigation, resulting in less smooth user experiences when switching pages. Deca aims to offer a solution that balances performance and scalability, enabling Hugo to deliver a documentation experience on par with modern front-end frameworks.
